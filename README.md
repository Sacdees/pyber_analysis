# Overview of Analysis 
## pyber_analysis

In this analysis we were obligated to use Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to inspect data and to merge data sets to perform calculations, create new data series and frames for the city types, driver and all other relevant data from the csv files delivered for analysis.  Using Matplotbib we were able to produce the quality figures and visual data to meet the needs of V. Isualize. With the new position we have started out with small data sets and been able to explore and analyze date by combining the data set to a more manageable format to make executive data drive decisions for Pyber and Omar.

# Results
We were able to import the data into Pandas DataFrames, merge the Dataframes and create a chart that showcases the average fare by city type over a period of four months along with average fare data to compile a comprehensive report by each city type:

## Total Amount of Fares 
Rural           $4327.93
Suburban        $19356.33
Urban           $39854.38

## Average Fare per Ride
Rural           $34.62
Suburban        $30.97
Urban           $24.53

## Average Fare per Driver
Rural           $55.49
Suburban        $39.50
Urban           $16.57

#----------------------------#

### Total Rides 
Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

### Total Driver
Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

# Summary 
As the data in the charts demonstrates, the Urban city type fares are much greater on average the other two city types, with Suburban and Rural following respectively. The results would indicate that there is more consumable income with less drivers in the Rural areas per driver, however there are more rides taken in Urban areas - perhaps on shorter trips resulting in a lower per driver average but with a result of the larger fare gross.  Overall the Suburban market is evenly placed between the other two segements in terms of all data presented.
