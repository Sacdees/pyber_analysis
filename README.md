# Overview of Analysis 
## pyber_analysis

In this anaylyis we were obligated to use Juypter Notebook and Pandas to inspect data and to merge data sets in order to perform calculations, create new data series and frames for the city types, driver and all other relevant data from the csv files devlivered for analysis.  Using Matplotbib we were able to produce the quality figures and visual data to meet the needs of V. Isualize. With the new position we have started out with small data sets and been able to explore and analyize date by combinging the data set to a more manageble format to make executive data drive descisions for Pyber and Omar. 


# Results
We were able to import the data into Pandas DataFrames, merge the dataframes and create a chart that showcases the average fare by city type over a period of four months
