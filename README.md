One of the questions V. Isualize is famous for asking during these presentations is about the exploratory part of the analytical process. In other words, when you have a new dataset, what is your process in determining relationships between variables in the data? Or what type of data do you have to work with? And are there any outliers or patterns in the data?

his critical, exploratory data analytic step can save roughly 15â€“50% of your time on a project because it provides a targeted plan for how to clean, sort, and create smaller datasets. It's not something a savvy analyst will skip. And of course you want V. Isualize to immediately recognize you as a savvy analyst!


Up to this point, you've been working with a small dataset, but soon you'll be analyzing large datasets that will be read into a DataFrame. Since you're getting to be an expert at creating visuals, Omar is going to show you how to plot data from a DataFrame just by referencing the data columns.
